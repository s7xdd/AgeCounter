# AgeCounter

Hi Humans!

This is an android app to count your age in minutes using your Date Of Birth! The app currently has a Date Selector which pops up a date selector window. It shows the selected date as well as the age in minutes after selecting a date.

Here is a picture of how the application looks!

Update 1 : Limited the date picker to restrict from selecting dates above the current date

Update 2 : Made the Selected Date and Minutes text to appear in bold
